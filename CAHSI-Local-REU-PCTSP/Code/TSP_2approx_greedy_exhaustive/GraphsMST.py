# Traveling Sales Man (TSP) premise states:
# "Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible 
#  route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point."

# Two important things about the problem statement: 
# Visit every city exactly once
# Cover the shortest path

# The Algorithm :
# Let 0 be the starting and ending point for salesman.
# Construct Minimum Spanning Tree with 0 as root using Primâ€™s Algorithm.
# List vertices visited in preorder walk/Depth First Search of the constructed MST and add source node at the end.

# Triangle-Inequality: The least distant path to reach a vertex j from i is always to reach j directly from i, rather than through some
# other vertex k (or vertices), i.e., dis(i, j) is always less than or equal to dis(i, k) + dist(k, j).

# Graph is based on adjacency matrix.
